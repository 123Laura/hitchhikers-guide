# Goals of the Fellowship - the Why

## Motivation

## Concepts

* **Training vs Delivery** how DSSG is an ‘externship’; each project has certain goals - some of them will produce analysis reports, others will produce models and “insights” based on those models, others will generate ranked/scored lists, and some will be software prototypes. Most likely, only a few projects will get implemented by their project partners after the summer. Some will be followed up with pilots and field trials, before deciding when/if to deploy/implement.
* **Deliverables** how the projects won’t be production code, but must be reproducible (run on different machine without prior knowledge), how many teams use out-of-the-box ML because ETL takes time, and results are more important than methods; encourage people to set up peer-learning groups / reading groups (e.g. like Deep Learning club)
* **Expectations of Fellows** What we expect fellows to do and what we don’t expect them to do, and what we expect them not to do
* **Expectations of PMs/TMs** Clear formulation of the PM role, how they help with managing expectations and outcomes with project partners, how they can ensure that each team member achieving his/her personal and learning goals, how they can maintain atmosphere of training program rather than consulting company
* **Fellow Advocate** point of contact for conflicts within teams, with mentors, and with leadership: set up a clear, confidential contact person outside of leadership. motivate why this person is important (i.e., list potential sources of conflict at the beginning of the fellowship)
