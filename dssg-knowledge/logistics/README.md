# Summer Overview and What to Expect

## Concepts
- Introduce key people, role of staff - PM/TM pods, expectations and roles
- [High level summer overview](high-level-summer-plan.pdf) 
- Scheduling and “Typical Day”: There will be on average one daily all-DSSG event (schedule set beforehand), it will be clearly stated what is and isn’t mandatory.
   - Standups - Checking in once a week with the whole fellowship, and usually daily with your team and PM 
   - Deep dives - Wednesday, two teams give twenty minute overview each that gives a deeper dive into their project, with a focus on the "theme" of that week. 
   - Tutorials & Teach-outs - Twice a week (Monday/Thursday) at lunchtime (Solicitation for teachouts, talk to Jane).
   - Discussion groups - 4 groups meeting Friday afternoons (one person from each team in each discussion group), around ethics in tech & data. Topics can be outside readings from industry or academia or issues fellows have encountered in their work. 
   - Friday speakers
   - Happy hours
  - Summer Kick-off Party
  - Data Fest and Conference 

# Culture, Curriculum and Communcations 

## Concepts
* **Code of Conduct Overview**
* **Curriculum Overview** What to expect this week and for the rest of the fellowship.
* **Training vs. Delivery** Each project will have a different goal - some of them will produce analysis reports, some produce insights based on models, some generate ranked/scored lists, and some will be software prototypes. All will evolve over the summer, and not all will be implemented. Some will be implemented, some will lead to pilots and field trials, and some die on the vine due to unforeseen circumstances with data or personnel at partner organizations. A handful will continue at DSaPP. Projects won’t be production code, but must be reproducible (run on different machine without prior knowledge). Many teams use out-of-the-box ML because ETL takes time, and results are more important than methods.
* **Expectations of Fellows** What we expect fellows to do and what we *don’t* expect them to do, and what we expect them *not* to do
* **Expectations of PMs/TMs** Clear formulation of the PM role, how they help with managing expectations and outcomes with project partners, how they can ensure that each team member achieving their personal and learning goals.
* **Fellow Advocate** We've selected you as fellows and now we are completely committed to supporting you. If you are having trouble within your team, with leadership, or with the fellowship in general, please contact one of your fellow advocates. All communication will be kept completely confidential.

     * Rob Mitchum via private Slack message or by call/text at (773) 484-9890.
