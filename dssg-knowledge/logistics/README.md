# Logistics and What to Expect

## Motivation

## Concepts
- Introduce key people, role of staff - PM/TM pods, expectations and roles
- [High level summer overview](high-level-summer-plan.pdf)
- Timeline of a Typical Project: It’s OK to catch up on technical skills (e.g. by learning from peers) in the beginning; stress how social science questions become most relevant after the initial data cleaning stage (e.g. understanding biases in the data, or defining outcome variables).
- Scheduling and “Typical Day”: There will be on average one daily all-DSSG event (schedule set beforehand), it will be clearly stated what is and isn’t mandatory.
   - Standups
   - Deep dives
   - Tutorials
   - Teach-outs (solicitation for teachouts, especially for social science; try to match fellows’ teachouts with skills that are required during the summer)
   - Discussion groups
   - Friday speakers
   - Happy hours
  - Summer Kickoff Party
  - Data Fest and Conference 

# Culture and Goals of the Fellowship 

## Motivation

## Concepts
* **Code of Conduct** 
* **Training vs Delivery** how DSSG is an ‘externship’; each project has certain goals - some of them will produce analysis reports, others will produce models and “insights” based on those models, others will generate ranked/scored lists, and some will be software prototypes. Most likely, only a few projects will get implemented by their project partners after the summer. Some will be followed up with pilots and field trials, before deciding when/if to deploy/implement.
* **Deliverables** how the projects won’t be production code, but must be reproducible (run on different machine without prior knowledge), how many teams use out-of-the-box ML because ETL takes time, and results are more important than methods; encourage people to set up peer-learning groups / reading groups (e.g. like Deep Learning club)
* **Curriculum Overview**
* **Expectations of Fellows** What we expect fellows to do and what we don’t expect them to do, and what we expect them not to do
* **Expectations of PMs/TMs** Clear formulation of the PM role, how they help with managing expectations and outcomes with project partners, how they can ensure that each team member achieving his/her personal and learning goals
* **Fellow Advocate** point of contact for conflicts within teams, with mentors, and with leadership: set up a clear, confidential contact person outside of leadership. motivate why this person is important (i.e., list potential sources of conflict at the beginning of the fellowship)
