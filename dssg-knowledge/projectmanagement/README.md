# Project Communications 

## Motivation
This is many fellows' first time working in projects on teams and with partners in professional settings. 

## Concepts
- Communications with partners (who conducts them, how often, professional standards for conducts)
- Email communication and accounts 
- How does PM work at DSSG and within their team? Which media to use when? How often should you check them? Trello, email, Slack, etc. 
- Calendars and scheduling - do they have access to the correct calendars, what are norms if something is moved 
- Refining project scope over the summer - how to talk to (and handle disagreements with) partners and deal with pushback, dealing with change and ambiguity, what if you have ethical concerns about your project
