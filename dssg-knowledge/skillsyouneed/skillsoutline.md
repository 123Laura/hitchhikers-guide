#Skills You Need
The following five skill levels can help you gauge where you stand and what things would be useful to brush up on or seek out:   
*   [Level 0 - Fellow](#fellow): what you should know before coming to the fellowship.
*   [Level 1 - Rookie](#rookie): what you should know after orientation.
*   [Level 2 - Cool Kid](#cool-kid): what you should know at the end of the fellowship. 
*   [Level 3 - Data Scientist for Social Good](#data-scientist-for-social-good): what you should know to practice in this field.
*   [Level 4 - Data Witch](#data-witch): skills that are nice to have if you get the chance to pick them up.

###Programming and tools

**Best practices**

*   Use `logging`, `print` is evil, here are some [good practices for logging in Python](http://victorlin.me/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python)
*   Writing documentation

**Data visualization**

*   [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - De facto standard in Python, most visualization tools are built on top of matplotlib (it has a low-level API)
*   [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) - statistical data visualization. A nice option for doing statistical plots, provides a much higher level API than matplotlib
*   [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) - this is probably the best option available for plotting maps in Python
*   [bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) - interactive plots in Python

**Databases**

*   SQL vs NoSQL

using D3
using APIs to get data
Scraping
R
Parallelization
parallel for loops
mapreduce
spark
SQL DBs: types of DBs - postgres, mysql, sqllite, ms sql server, oracle
NoSQ	 DBs	
Types - pros and cons
Using one of them from python

###Computer Science
Algorithmic complexity

###Math and Stats

###Machine Learning

*   Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
*   Bias-variance tradeoff
*   Feature generation
*   Feature selection
*   Ranking

    *   Selecting proper metrics
    *   Plots
