#Skills You Need
The following five skill levels can help you gauge where you stand and what things would be useful to brush up on or seek out:   
*   [Level 0 - Fellow](#fellow): what you should know before coming to the fellowship.
*   [Level 1 - Rookie](#rookie): what you should know after orientation.
*   [Level 2 - Cool Kid](#cool-kid): what you should know at the end of the fellowship. 
*   [Level 3 - Data Scientist for Social Good](#data-scientist-for-social-good): what you should know to practice in this field.
*   [Level 4 - Data Witch](#data-witch): skills that are nice to have if you get the chance to pick them up.
