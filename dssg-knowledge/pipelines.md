# Pipelines and Project Workflow *(due week 1)*

## Motivation
Every team will develop some sort of pipeline for their project. Teams that are less experienced will develop bad pipelines, and it's not the best use of their time or the best learning experience for them to spend time reinventing the wheel in a worse way. We want them to have an example of something basic and decent so there is a minimum baseline. 

## Concepts
* In general, we are not writing production code - practically, it needs to be one step above good academic code
* Connect this to the summer schedule (approximately where will you be at each week) and an example pipeline
