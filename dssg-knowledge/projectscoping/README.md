# Project Scoping

## Motivation
Fellows will be meeting partners in week 2. Projects have been scoped, but this will need to be continually refined as fellows talk to the partners, get a better understanding of the project, and start to work with the data. 

## Concepts
Selecting projects - what criteria did we use, 1) social impact, 2) partners that are able to commit, have data, 3) post process continuation, why we didnâ€™t do a bike share, what will you be doing in week 2, thinking critically about what the partner will do with it, what are actions/interventions, do they have the data to do what they want to do?
