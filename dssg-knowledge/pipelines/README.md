# Pipelines and Project Workflow

## Motivation
Every team will develop some sort of pipeline for their project. Less experienced teams haven’t had experience structuring their workflows, and we want them to have a decent example so they don’t waste time slowly developing a problematic pipeline. Although teams aren’t necessarily writing production code, they will need to hand over an end-to-end working product at the end of the summer. They need to document all ETL and modeling, so that someone unfamiliar with the project can *understand what they did* as well as *run their code and reproduce their results*. 

## Concepts
Connect this to the [summer schedule](dssg-knowledge/logistics/high-level-summer-plan.pdf) (approximately where will you be at each week) and an example pipeline.
