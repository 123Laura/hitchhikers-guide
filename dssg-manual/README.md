_We put together this manual for incoming Data Science for Social Good Fellows at the University of Chicago. We are making it public to provide insight into DSSG to fellows, mentors, project partners, and anyone else interested in doing data science for social good._

Welcome to the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Fellowship program! We hope your experience this summer will help you grow your skills as a data scientist and help you learn how to apply those skills to solve real-world problems with social impact. This manual outlines our goals in running this fellowship program, our hopes for your experience, and our expectations of the participants. Additionally, weâ€™ve outlined what you can expect from us and the structure of the summer.
