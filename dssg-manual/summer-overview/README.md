# Summer Overview and What to Expect

We get a lot of questions about what to expect from the summer. While specific timing will vary from project to project, the summer will follow roughly the structure below. See also [high level summer plan](high-level-summer-plan.pdf). 

## Before the Summer

Prior to your arrival, we will send you a variety of pre-training resources so you can start working with and learning how to use the tools you’ll use all summer. These resources will include a list of software to install prior to your arrival and tools/programming languages you should brush up on. We will also send you a list of projects and ask for your preferences on which projects you'd like to work on in the summer. Based on your preferences, the needs of the project, and the balance of disciplines for each team, we will create a team of 3-4 fellows for each project.

## Learning about Projects and Partners

Year-round staff at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy (DSaPP) work hard to recruit and scope projects throughout the year. Because of various logistical hurdles (think legal data sharing agreements and data transfer challenges), project partners will be finalized on an on-going basis all the way up to the start of the fellowship. As such, you will not receive your project assignment until the second week of DSSG.

After orientation, you will spend the first part of the summer getting to know your project partner and their challenges. While the project will have been initially scoped, you will have the opportunity to refine that scope by working with your project partner throughout the summer. For example, we may have initially worked with a project partner to determine a goal of finding violations of a particular law or code. Your team would then work with the partner to narrow that to: (1) locations at risk of violations in general; (2) locations at risk of multiple violations; or (3) locations with the most impactful violations.

While we know you are eager to dig into data immediately, data science for social good is not just about data and cannot happen in a vacuum. We believe that it is important for you to thoroughly understand the problem you are trying to solve and underlying issues in order to approach your solution more intentionally. Not only do evaluation metrics depend on your specific goals, but understanding and knowledge of the problem is crucial in understanding what your variables even mean. To help with that initial context, most project partners will come on site during the first two weeks and spend a couple of days with their team.

## Working on Your Project

We aim to have all data from project partners well in advance of the fellowship, but that's never really possible. We sometimes have delays in getting data or get partial data that needs to be augmented during the fellowship. As you explore the data, you'll find holes in the data that was provided and will need to work with the project partner to fix that. That’s the reality of working with partners that collect sensitive data.

Fellows drive the work of every project, learning their subject matter in depth, writing code, and collaborating with their project partner on their final deliverables. Over the course of the summer, your team will:

* Explore your data
* Design your project workflow
* Identify user stories
* Develop a machine learning pipeline
* Build relevant models
* Improve feature and pipeline engineering
* Evaluate using the metrics that make sense for your project
* Develop additional final deliverables (API, dashboard applications, etc) 

## Presentations

We believe that our work is only useful if we are able to communicate about it with our partners, peers, as well as the general public. As such, an important piece of this training program is learning to present about the work you do. 

Each week, a member of your team will give a 2-3 minute update to the entire fellowship, outlining your progress to date and the work you aim to complete the following week. Twice during the summer, your team will present a 20-minute deep dive, outlining the more technical components of your project and seeking feedback from other fellows and mentors.

At the end of the summer, your team will develop two polished presentations: one 5-minute presentation for the final DSSG Data Fest event, and one 20-minute technical presentation for use at conferences, local Meetup events, and presenting at your home institution. Each group will be assigned a local meetup to give their presentation. In preparation for the DSSG Data Fest, our communications staff will work with you on both of these presentations, brainstorming ways to present your work and providing feedback on your delivery. 

## Wrap-Up and Handovers 

We want to make sure the work you do over the summer has real impact. For that impact to happen, a lot more needs to be done after you finish the summer. Some of that work is done by the project partner, some of it is done by the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago, and some of it may even be one by the fellows who continue to stay involved. What is critical for that follow-up work to take place is that you wrap up and document your work well so that others can continue and sustain your efforts. We also need to make sure that we transition the work over to the project partners so they can continue to extend, validate, implement, and deploy your work.
