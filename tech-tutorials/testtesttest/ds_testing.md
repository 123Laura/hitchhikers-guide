### Tools

-   [hypotehsis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-python)- Python library to look for edge cases without explicitly coding them
-   [engarde](https://github.com/TomAugspurger/engarde) - Use Python decorators to test a function outcome (this project had good potential but it's dead now)
-   [feature forge](https://github.com/machinalis/featureforge) - Testing features for ML models (also seems dead)
