# Software testing



## What? I don't need to test it. My code is bug free

## Software testing in Python

### Tools

*   unittest (part of the Python standard library)

*   [py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/) (if you don't know which to use, use this)

*   [nose](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose)

## Testing Data Science pipelines

This is a good overview of testing for Data Science: [Testing for Data Scientists by Trey Causey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEqM9uJi64Q)

### Tools

*   [hypotehsis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-python)- Python library to look for edge cases without explicitly coding them
*   [engarde](https://github.com/TomAugspurger/engarde) - Use Python decorators to test a function outcome (this project had good potential but it's dead now)
*   [feature forge](https://github.com/machinalis/featureforge) - Testing features for ML models (also seems dead)

## Automatically testing your projects

### Continous integration
