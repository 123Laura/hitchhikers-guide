Git is a *free* version control system which helps you keep track of file changes in your computer. Think of it as a time machine that lets you go back to any point in your projects development.

While git is most used in software development, you can use it for anything you like ([writing books](https://www.gitbook.com/), for example), as long as your files are plain text (e.g. source code, latex files), you won't have any issue with git.

Simply speaking, git saves snapshots of your work called `commits`, after a `commit` is done, you can go back and forth to check the state of your project, maybe you were experimenting with some new function and realized the old one was better, no problem, you can bring back anything!

Every version of your project is stored in your computer, but we know that's dangerous, so you can also host a remote copy (think of this as a backup, just like Dropbox)

## What is github?

There are [many](https://gitlab.com/), [many](https://bitbucket.org/) providers that let you store your git repositories (that's how you call a *git project*) but the most widely used is [github](https://github.com/) (you'll be using it for dssg).

Apart from storing a copy of your projects, github comes with a lot of useful features. For example, you can use it to share your projects with your colleagues, so they can see (or modify if you want) your project.

## git sounds awesome! How do I get it?

Chances are, git is already installed on your computer. If not, you can get it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

OS X users: use homebrew, if you don't know what homebrew is, you probably didn't read the prerequisites :(

## Can I get buttons and stuff?

git is a command line tool, which means it doesn't have a graphical user interface. Using the git cli is the most flexible way of doing it and if you are working on a remote serve (like in dssg) is best way of using it. However, if you still want a GUI (for using git in your computer), here are some options available:

*   [Some options for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac)
*   [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (Windows and Mac)

## Ok, now how do I do the magic?
