Git is a version control system which helps you keep track of file changes in your computer. Think of it as a time machine that lets you go back to any point in your projects development.

While git is most used in software development, you can use it for anything you like ([writing books](https://www.gitbook.com/), for example), as long as your files are plain text (e.g. source code, latex files), you won't have any issue with git.

Simply speaking, git saves snapshots of your work called `commits`, after a `commit` is done, you can go back and forth to check the state of your project, maybe you were experimenting with some new function and realized the old one was better, no problem, you can bring back anything!

Every version of your project is stored in your computer, but we know that's dangerous, so you can also host a remote copy (think of this as a backup, just like Dropbox)

## What is github?

There are [many](https://gitlab.com/), [many](https://bitbucket.org/) providers that let you store your git repositories (that's how you call a *git project*) but the most widely used is [github](https://github.com/)
