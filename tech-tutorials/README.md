#Data Science for Social Good Curriculum
Our number one priority is to train fellows to do data science for social good 
work. We expect that every incoming fellow has experience programming in Python,
 a basic knowledge of statistics and social science, and an interest in doing 
social good. However, everyone comes from a different background, which is a 
strength of the program. To ensure that everyone starts the summer able
 to contribute and be a productive member of the team and the fellowship, 
we start the first few weeks off with an intensive orientation. 

After initial orientation, we usually have two lunch and learns per week,
taught by staff or by fellows with relevant specializations. Although we don't 
expect all twelve teams to be working in unison, there is a [general structure](https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide/blob/master/dssg-manual/summer-overview/high-level-summer-plan.pdf) 
to the summer that guides how we schedule the remaining curriculum. 
Our overarching teaching philosophy is as follows (see [meringue-making template](tutorial-template/) 
for an example):

- *You get out what you put in.* Fellows are encouraged to take an active role in shaping and teaching the curriculum as well as learning from it. 
- *You learn best by doing.* Lectures should be concise (under 45 minutes) and 
interactive wherever possible. Tutorials should be practical, accompanied by a 
worksheet or exercises (with solutions).
- *Motivation should be clear.* For more technical topics: what task 
will require this skill or tool? What other tools exist to do similar things? 
Why use this tool instead of others? What will it look like when something goes
 awry? For conceptual talks: why do we feel the need to present this topic? What
 are some concrete examples of where it went right and where it went wrong in
 the past?

We've assembled our curriculum materials for current and future fellows,
for those looking to start similar programs elsewhere, and for anyone who is 
interested in becoming a data scientist for social good to follow along at home:
