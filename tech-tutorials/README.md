#DSSG Orientation

- **Teaching philosophy**:
   - *You get out what you put in.* Fellows are encouraged to take an active role in shaping and teaching the curriculum as well as learning from it. We will try to communicate the motivation behind everything we teach, so if you have an opinion of a better tool to use or way to teach the concept, we'd love to hear it.
   - *You learn best by doing.* Clearly motivate lessons and talks (*For tech sessions:* What task will require this skill or tool? What other tools exist to do similar things? Why use this tool instead of others? What will it look like when something goes awry? *For conceptual talks:* Why do we feel the need to present this topic? What are some concrete examples of it going well and going wrong in the past?)
- Teaching sessions should last 45 minutes at the maximum and should be practical, accompanied by a worksheet/exercises with solutions and a cheat sheet with relevant commands (where applicable). Include a slide that suggests more advanced or theoretical aspects of the topic for future fellow teachouts. Provide a summary, a list of commands, and links to further resources in a markdown file. See [very serious template](tutorial-template/).
