#Curriculum Outline
We've distilled 4 years of projects at [Data Science for Social Good fellowship](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/) and the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/) and many (sort of) early mornings spent waxing poetic over Dunkin Donuts into our idea of "what makes a data scientist for social good." This departs from the (already nebulous) definition of a data scientist, placing more weight on the ability to understand social context and to work with partners from nonprofits and government agencies. Here is our blood, sweat, and tears distilled into one Github repo/manifesto: *The Hitchhiker's Guide to DSSG*.

There's a whole lot to know, so we split it up into 8 categories: 
- **Programming,** because you need to be able to use a computer to do data science
- **Computer science,** because you're going to have data big enough that you need to care about its structure
- **Math and stats,** because [everything else in life is just applied math](https://xkcd.com/435/)
- **Machine learning,** because you're going to want to do predictive modeling or find structure in your data 
- **Social science,** because you need to understand the context within which you're working and how you work *can* and *can't* generalize
- **Scoping and project management,** because you need to be able to work with people and  
- **Privacy, ethics, and security,** because data is people
- **Communications,** because the work you do should be implemented and understood


As the saying goes, when at DSSG do as the cool kids and data witches do. But cool kids and data witches aren't built in a day. We get a lot of questions about what fellows need to be competitive applicants for the program, or to know before they arrive, and what they can expect to learn over the summer. The five skill levels can help you gauge where you stand and what things would be useful to brush up on or seek out:   
*   [Level 0 - Fellow](#fellow): what you should know before you arrive.
*   [Level 1 - Rookie](#rookie): what you should know after orientation.
*   [Level 2 - Cool Kid](#cool-kid): what you should know at the end of the fellowship. 
*   [Level 3 - Data Scientist for Social Good](#data-scientist-for-social-good): what you should know to practice in this field.
*   [Level 4 - Data Witch](#data-witch): skills that are nice to have if you get the chance to pick them up.
