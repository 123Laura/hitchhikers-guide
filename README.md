#Curriculum Outline
We've distilled 4 years of [DSSG](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/) and [DSaPP](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/) projects and many (sort of) early mornings spent waxing poetic over Dunkin Donuts into our idea of "what makes a data scientist for social good." This departs from the (already nebulous) definition of a data scientist, placing more weight on the ability to understand social context and to work with partners from nonprofits and government agencies. Here is our blood, sweat, and tears distilled into one Github repo/manifesto: *The Hitchhiker's Guide to DSSG*.

There's a whole lot to know, so we split it up into 8 categories: 
- **Programming,** because you'll need to tell your computer what to do, usually by writing code 
- **Computer science,** because you'll need to manage your data and programs efficiently  
- **Math and stats,** because [everything else in life is just applied math](https://xkcd.com/435/)
- **Machine learning,** because you'll want to do predictive modeling or look for structure in your data 
- **Social science,** because you need to understand how your work *can* and *can't* generalize
- **Scoping and project management,** because you'll need to turn a real world problem into something you can model   
- **Privacy, ethics, and security,** because data is people
- **Communications,** because you want your work to be implemented and understood
- **Social issues,** because you care about people and need to think through the context you're working in


As the saying goes, when at DSSG do as the cool kids and data witches do. But cool kids and data witches aren't built in a day. We get a lot of questions about what fellows need to be competitive applicants for the program, or to know before they arrive, and what they can expect to learn over the summer. The following five skill levels can help you gauge where you stand and what things would be useful to brush up on or seek out:   
*   [Level 0 - Fellow](#fellow): what you should know before you arrive.
*   [Level 1 - Rookie](#rookie): what you should know after orientation.
*   [Level 2 - Cool Kid](#cool-kid): what you should know at the end of the fellowship. 
*   [Level 3 - Data Scientist for Social Good](#data-scientist-for-social-good): what you should know to practice in this field.
*   [Level 4 - Data Witch](#data-witch): skills that are nice to have if you get the chance to pick them up.
