#Curriculum Outline
We've distilled 4 years of [DSSG](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/) and [DSaPP](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/) projects and many (sort of) early mornings spent waxing poetic over Dunkin Donuts into our idea of "what makes a data scientist for social good." This departs from the (already nebulous) definition of a data scientist, placing more weight on the ability to understand social context and to work with partners from nonprofits and government agencies. Here is our blood, sweat, and tears distilled into one Github repo/manifesto: *The Hitchhiker's Guide to DSSG*.

There's a whole lot to know, so we split it up into 8 categories: 
- **Programming,** because you'll need to tell your computer what to do, usually by writing code. 
- **Computer science,** because you'll need to manage your data and programs efficiently.  
- **Math and stats,** because [everything else in life is just applied math](https://xkcd.com/435/).
- **Machine learning,** because you'll want to do predictive modeling or look for structure in your data.
- **Social science,** because you need to understand how your work *can* and *can't* generalize.
- **Scoping and project management,** because you'll need to turn a real world problem into something you can model.   
- **Privacy, ethics, and security,** because data is people.
- **Communications,** because you want your work to be implemented and understood.
- **Social issues,** because you care about people and need to think through the context you're working in.


As the saying goes, when at DSSG do as the cool kids and data witches do. But cool kids and data witches aren't built in a day. We get a lot of questions about what fellows need to apply for the program or before they arrive, and what they can expect to learn over the summer. If you are coming to DSSG, check out the [DSSG 2016 orientation schedule](#orientation-2016). If you won't be joining us this year, we're working on assembling the resources in our [skills outline](skills-you-need.md).


#DSSG Orientation

- **Themes/philosophy**:
   - *You get out what you put in* - Fellows are encouraged to take an active role in shaping and teaching the curriculum as well as learning from it. 
   - *You learn best by doing* - Clearly motivate lessons and talks (For tech sessions: What task will require this skill or tool? What other tools exist to do similar things? Why use this tool instead of others? For conceptual talks: Why do we feel the need to present this topic? What are some concrete examples of it going well or going wrong in the past?)
- Each day starts with 10 minutes recap of yesterday & outlook for today. There will be 15 minute AM break and a 30 minute PM break. Activities begin and end on time. State the motivation behind all activities as explicitly and as clearly as possible.
- If you are assigned to a session, it is now on your calendar and it is your responsibility to do it, or to delegate it to somebody else (e.g. TMs/PMs).
- **Tech Sessions:** Last 45 minutes at the maximum and should be practical, how-to accompanied by a worksheet/exercises (with solutions) and a cheat sheet with relevant commands. Include a slide that suggests more advanced or theoretical aspects of the topic for future fellow teachouts. Provide a summary, a list of commands, and links to further resources in a markdown file. See [very serious template](tech-tutorials/tutorialtemplate/)
- **ALL SESSIONS:** By 5/27, have materials prepared and added to repo. 

Orientation (the first two weeks of the fellowship) will cover the following topics:
