#Curriculum Outline
After four years working on data science projects with social impact through the [Data Science for Social Good fellowship](http://dssg.uchicago.edu/) and the [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/),  we've gleaned a lot of knowledge about what skills a "data scientist working in the social good" should possess. This list departs from the (already nebulous) definition of a data scientist in that it places more weight on the ability to understand social context and to work with partners from nonprofits and government agencies. Here is our blood, sweat, and tears distilled into one Github repo/manifesto: *The Hitchhiker's Guide to DSSG*.

There's a whole lot to know, so we split them up into 8 categories: 
- **Programming,** because you need to be able to use a computer to do data science
- **Computer science,** because you're going to have data big enough that you need to care about its structure
- **Math and stats,** because [everything else in life is just applied math](https://xkcd.com/435/)
- **Machine learning,** because you're going to want to do predictive modeling or find structure in your data 
- **Social science,** because you need to understand the context within which you're working and how you work *can* and *can't* generalize
- **Scoping and project management,** because you need to be able to work with people and  
- **Privacy, ethics, and security,** because data is people 
- **Communications,** because the work you do should be implemented and understood

*   [Level 1 - Rookie (required to know after orientation)](#rookie)
*   [Level 2 - Cool Kid (required to know after the summer is over)](#cool-kid)
*   [Level 3 - Data Scientist for Social Good (required to know after summer to do data science for social good)](#data-scientist-for-social-good)
*   [Level 4 - Data Witch (nice to know to be a good data scientist)](#data-witch)

This is a work in progress and we are always open to suggestions!
