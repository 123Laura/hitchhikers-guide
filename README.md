# The Hitchhiker's Guide to DSSG 
We at [DSSG](dssg.uchicago.edu) have spent many (sort of) early mornings waxing existential over Dunkin' Donuts and trying to define what makes a "data scientist for social good," that strange, enigmatic breed: one part data scientist, one part consultant, one part educator, and (at least) one part bleeding heart idealist. We offer you a roundabout definition in the form of the skills and knowledge one would need, which can roughly be divided into the following categories:
- **Programming,** because you'll need to tell your computer what to do, usually by writing code. 
- **Computer science,** because you'll need to understand how your data is - and should be - structured, as well as the algorithms you use to analyze it.  
- **Math and stats,** because [everything else in life is just applied math](https://xkcd.com/435/), and numerical results are meaningless without some measure of uncertainty.
- **Machine learning,** because you'll want to models to predict or describe things in the world, and will want the models to learn, evolve, and improve over time.
- **Social science,** because you'll need to understand when correlation can plausibly suggest causation, and how to design experiments to validate your models in the field.
- **Scoping and project management,** because you'll need to be able to talk to your partners about how to turn the data they have relates to the problems you're trying to solve, to turn these insights into a useful solution, and to work with a team to make the useful thing actually happen.
- **Privacy, ethics, and security,** because data is people, so you'll need to consider the real world implications of using it as well as keep the data secure. 
- **Communications,** because you'll need to be able to describe the methods you use, and to tell the story of why what you're doing matters to a broader audience. 
- **Social issues,** because you're doing this work because you care about people, and you're not doing it in a vacuum, which means you need to understand the co and history within which you're working. 

As the saying goes, when at DSSG, do as the cool kids (and data witches) do. But cool kids (and data witches) aren't built in a day. So we've put together resources for before, during, and after the summer. If you are coming to DSSG, check out the [prerequisites](dssg-knowledge/prerequisites/) and the [2016 orientation schedule](DSSG2016OrientationSchedule.pdf). If you won't be joining us this year, you can still follow along with the [tutorials](tech-tutorials/) given throughout the summer, and we're working on assembling further resources in a comprehensive outline of the [skills you need to do Data Science for Social Good](dssg-knowledge/skills-you-need/).
