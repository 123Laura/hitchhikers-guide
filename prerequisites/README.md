## How to install pre-requisites?

*   **OS X** users - Follow this [instructions](osx.md)
*   **Linux** users - You probably know how to do it, but still [check this](https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide/blob/master/prerequisites/osx.md#step-3-install-python-tools) for information on Python tools
*   **Windows** users - We don't have a guide yet (any volunteers?)



## Asking for help

We just started this repo but we want the [issues section](https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide/issues) to be a knowledge base for common problems.

If you have any trouble installing anything check closed issues. If you don't find the answer, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide/issues/new) and someone will help you.

*To open issues, you need to create a Github account (you'll need it for the summer anyway).*
