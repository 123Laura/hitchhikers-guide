    "Networks are measurable representations of patterns of relationships connecting entities in an abstract or actual space. Networks have been used to model airplane traffic from airports, supply chains, amorphous materials like window glass, cells, and proteins. They can also be used to model relationships among people. Social networks are patterns of relationships among people or organizations that affect and are affected by actions of individuals within the network. Network analysis captures the effect of the complete pattern of conections among individuals in a group to help us perform structural analysis of outcomes of interest for individuals and the group as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Networks can be represented as **graphs**, where a graph is made up of **nodes** connected by **ties**. The flexibility of network analysis means that the first step toward analysis is to clearly define what constitutes a node and what constitutes a tie in your network. There are several type of graphs: connected, unconnected, directional, and many more (see [glossary](#glossary-of-terms) for a list of terms). \n",

    "## Glossary of Terms\n",
    "- A **node** is an individual entity within a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **tie** is a link between nodes. Ties can be **undirected**, meaning they represent a symmetrical\n",
    "relationship, or **directed**, meaning they represent an asymmetrical relationship (one that doesn't necessarily\n",
    "go both ways). \n",
    "\n",
    "- A directed tie is known as an **arc**. An undirected tie is known as an **edge**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **degree** of a node is the number of ties connected to that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **directed graph** has directed ties, which depict an asymmetrical relationship. For instance, I may \n",
    "follow Barack Obama on Instagram, but that does not necessarily mean that he follows me. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An **undirected graph** has ties that depict a symmetrical or reciprocal relationship. For instance, if I am Facebook friends with Barack Obama, then he is also Facebook friends with me. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **cutpoint** is a *node* that cannot be removed without disconnecting the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **bridge** is a *tie* that cannot be removed without disconnecting the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Two nodes are said to be **reachable** when they are connected by an unbroken chain of relationships through\n",
    "other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network density** is the number of *actual* connections in a network divided by the number of *potential*\n",
    "connections in that network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average distance** is the average path length between nodes in a graph. It is a measure of how many nodes \n",
    "it takes to transmit information across the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Centrality** is the degree to which a network revolves around a given node. \n",

When one of the faction heads, individuals 1 and 34, called a meeting, they would communicate the information only to members in their own faction, in order to ensure that they would hold the majority of members present at the meeting.
