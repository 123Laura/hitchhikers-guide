    "*fitting* or *estimating* a function, or *training* or *building* a model. These terms are all synonyms and are \n",
    "used interchangeably in the machine learning literature.\n",
    "- **Examples**: These are what you probably know as *data points* or *observations*. \n",
    "- **Features**: These are what you probably know as *independent variables*, *attributes*, *predictors*, \n",
    "or *explanatory variables.*\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: This happens when a model is too simple and does not capture the structure of the data well \n",
    "enough.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: This happens when a model is too complex or too sensitive to the noise in the data; this can\n",
    "result in poor generalization performance, or applicability of the model to new data. \n",
    "- **Regularization**: This is a general method to avoid overfitting by applying additional constraints to the model. \n",
    "For example, you can limit the number of features present in the final model, or the weight coefficients applied\n",
    "to the (standardized) features are small.\n",
    "- **Supervised learning** involves problems with one target or outcome variable (continuous or discrete) that we want\n",
    "to predict, or classify data into. Classification, prediction, and regression fall into this category. We call the\n",
    "set of explanatory variables $X$ **features**, and the outcome variable of interest $Y$ the **label**.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** involves problems that do not have a specific outcome variable of interest, but rather\n",
    "we are looking to understand \"natural\" patterns or groupings in the data - looking to uncover some structure that \n",
    "we do not know about a priori. Clustering is the most common example of unsupervised learning. Another example is \n",

This type of modeling is very useful for *interpretation*. Machine learning models do not generally optimize for obtaining a structural form of the model; they can take many different structural forms (ranging from linear models to sets of rules to more complex forms), and it may not always be possible to write them down in a compact form as an equation.

    "### Comparing to a Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "We get an accuracy score of 0.45340... (45%). This is not a great score, however, it is much better than random guessing, which would have had a chance of 1/18 of succeeding. The other way to guess would be to take the mode, which in this case is MEDICINE with a frequency of 22497, which would give us an accuracy score of 22497/49013 = 45.9%. So logistic regression is about as good as just always assigning the mode when department is missing. Let's see if other classifiers can do any better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "Before we dive into metrics, it is important to highlight that classification models typically do not output 0/1 values directly; rather, they produce a score, usually between 0 and 1 (sometimes a probability), that is discretized into a 0 or 1 based on a user-specified threshold. A common default threshold is 0.5, which you can think of as classifying any example that is \"most likely\" (more than half) positive as positive, and any example that is \"most likely\" negative as negative. However, it's important to note that this threshold is arbitrary, and you should select your threshold based on the data, the model, and the problem you are solving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've turned the real-valued predictions into 0/1 classification, we can create a *confusion matrix* from these predictions. Each data point has a *true value* which is either positive or negative, and the (thresholded) prediction of the classifier is either correct or incorrect. Therefore we have four buckets: true positives $(TP)$, false positives $(FP)$, true negatives $(TN)$, and false negatives $(FN)$; and the total number of positive examples is $TP + FN = P^\\prime$, while the total number of negative examples is $TN + FP = N^\\prime$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** is the ratio of correct predictions (both positive and negative) to all predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} = \\frac{TP + TN}{P + N} = \\frac{ TP + TN}{P^\\prime + N^\\prime}. $\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is the most commonly described evaluation metric for classication, but is (perhaps surprisingly) one of the least useful in practical situations. For example, a model with 85% accuracy sounds like it's performing pretty well, but if we are trying to classify a population with 95% positive and 5% negative examples, we could make a *really stupid* classifier, labeling *every example* as positive, and still beat our 85% accurate model in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two additional commonly used metrics are **precision** and **recall**, defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{TP}{P}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{TP}{P^\\prime}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures the accuracy of the classifier *when it predicts an example to be positive*: how many of the examples that were labeled positive are truly positive? Recall measures the ability of the classifier to *find positive examples*: how many of the positive examples were labeled positive?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is often a tradeoff between precision and recall. By selecting different classification thresholds, we can vary and tune the precision and recall of a given classifier. A highly conservative classifier that only predicts a 1 when it is very confident (say, threshold 0.999) will most often be correct when it predicts a 1 (high precision) but will miss most 1s (low recall). At the other extreme, a classifier that hands out 1s like candy (say, threshold 0.001) will have very high recall but very low precision. \n",

    "\n",
    "The cross-validation and holdout set approaches described above assume that the data have no time dependencies, and that the distributions of their values are stationary over time. This assumption is almost always violated in practice, and will affect performance estimates. In most practical problems, we want to use a validation strategy that emulates the way in which our models will be used and provides an accurate performance estimate. We'll call this *temporal validation*. For a given point in time, we train models only information that would have been available to us before that time to avoid training on data from the \"future.\" Your test set would then be all the observations within a window after time $t$. \n",
    "- How far out in the future do the predictions need to be made? For example, if the set of students who need to be targeted for interventions has to be finalized at the beginning of the school year for the entire year, then $d$=1 year.\n",
    "- How often will the model be updated? If the model is being updated daily, then we can move the window a day at a time to reflect this scenario.\n",
    "- How often will the system get new data? If we are getting new data frequently, we can make predictions more frequently."
