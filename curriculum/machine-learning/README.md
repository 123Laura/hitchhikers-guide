# Machine Learning and Practical Validity

## Motivation
You've probably heard about machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. It's 
an integral part of data science. So we'll teach you the basics about ML: the 
process, formulating a problem in a machine learning setting, feature generation,
model selection and evaluation, and how to interpret results before eventually deploying the models. 

Doing machine learning in a social good setting. People coming from social science or statistics might be alarmed at throwing every possible variable. 

- Mapping a social problem to an ML problem 
  - Defining an objective function
  - Ethical questions 
  - Potential for misuse 
  - Implicit and explicit assumptions
  - Sources of bias in sample and labels
- Feature selection and regularization
- Model evaluation
  - Constructing training/test split
  - AUC/precision/recall
  - Deciding on a reasonable metric (ranked list/precision at top K)
  - Generalizability 
- Cross Validation
  - Temporal CV and Leakage
  - Choosing granularity/observation level
  - Choosing prediction date
  - Difference between training window and aggregation window (features)
  - How does model update when more data is added
