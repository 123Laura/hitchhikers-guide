# Temporal Cross-Validation 

## Motivation
Most projects will aim to predict some *outcome* before it happens, need to build models that donâ€™t leak information, therefore estimating your performance as accurately and honestly as possible.

## Concepts
* How to choose granularity/observation level (predicting in the next day/week/year)
* How to set up training and test sets (both conceptually and technically)
* Difference between training window (observations) and aggregation windows (features)
* How *not* to "cross-contaminate" 
* How does your model update when more data is added?
