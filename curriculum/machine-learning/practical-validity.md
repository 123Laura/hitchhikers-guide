# Machine Learning and Practical Validity *(due week 4)*

## Motivation
By definition this work involves removing the human element of a problem to turn it into an optimization problem. It is important to think about how to do that and what the pitfalls are.

## Concepts
* Mapping a social science problem to machine learning (optimization) problem
* Defining an objective function
* Ethical questions
* Potential for misuse 
* Evaluation and validation (just because you’re modeling something well doesn’t mean it’s what you think you’re modeling, or that the application will be effective)
* Social implications (and potential biases) should be worked out
* Contextualizing project from a data-driven, practical perspective.
