# The Work We Do, Social Good Data Challenges, Evil Caveats *(due week 1)*

## Motivation

## Concepts
* In-depth case studies of a handful of projects - what was the goal, what did the project end up being, what were the bumps along the way
* Past projects of different kinds (e.g. Lead, Police, LID)
* Resource allocation projects (e.g. EPA, High School)
* Dangers (e.g. similarity of technology between EPA and Predictive Policing, but not interpretation/implementation)
* Misinterpretations of data or results, how miscommunication can lead to bad decisions
* How projects evolve over time
