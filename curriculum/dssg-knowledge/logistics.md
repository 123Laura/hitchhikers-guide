# Logistics and What to Expect

## Motivation


## Concepts
- Introduce key people
- Timeline of a Typical Project: It’s OK to catch up on technical skills (e.g. by learning from peers) in the beginning; stress how social science questions become most relevant after the initial data cleaning stage (e.g. understanding biases in the data, or defining outcome variables).

- Scheduling and “Typical Day”: There will be on average one daily all-DSSG event (set schedule beforehand before people get in routines), it will be clearly stated what is and isn’t mandatory.
- Standups
- Deep dives
- Tutorials
- Teach-outs (solicitation for teachouts, especially for social science; try to match fellows’ teachouts with skills that are required during the summer)
- Discussion groups
- Friday speakers
- Happy hours
- Beginning of Summer Party and Data Fest
- Manual and Code of Conduct
- Curriculum
